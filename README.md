# Shopper 
Shopper is a ruby on rails project which explores
aws ruby api features through localstack, with a strong emphasis 
on S3 Buckets usage for storage. Localstack allows developers to 
simulate the aws ecosystem before product launch and expose most of the 
AWS services such as S3 storage etc.
More info on localstack can be found here [localstack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/)
